# Annona
Annona is a digital marketplace designed to bring order to the Rutgers dining experience.

The Problem

Rutgers dining hall menus are currently long, unformatted, and difficult to navigate. Students often find themselves "winging it," missing out on the best options or failing to track their nutritional goals.

The Solution

Annona transforms the dining experience into a modular, DoorDash-style interface. By categorizing daily menus into interactive blocks and surfacing community-rated "Creations," we provide students with the intelligence they need to fuel their day.
